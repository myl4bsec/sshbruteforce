What is?
--------

Brutessh is a program that uses the paramiko ssh library, to launch bruteforce passwords attacks to the sshd service.
The tools is multithreading and uses a dictionary for the passwords.
It's a really simple tool, most of the work is thanks to paramiko library.

How to:
-------

It has very few options:

python brutessh.py -h targethost -u user -d passwordict

And you can set the number of threads with the -t parameter, by default it has 12 threads, 
you could play with the number, but i think it's ok as it is.

Dependencies:
------------
You need to have installed the Crypto module for python, paramiko need it.

For example, Debian: python-crypto
